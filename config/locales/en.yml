# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  event_type:
    rally:
      short_description: "Host a large public rally or march to garner public and media attention to your cause"
      full_description: "Rallies are large events (ideally 20 or more people) intended to garner public and media attention to sway 
              public opinion on an important issue. Rallies can look very different from one another, but generally they have at least
              1-3 speakers, signs, and chants. They can last anywhere from 10 minutes to all day, but most rallies are 30 minutes to an 
              hour long. With some time and effort, a good rally can come together in just a few days when necessary, but, if you can, 
              we suggest giving yourself and your team at least a week to a month to organize a successful rally."
    public_speak_out:
      short_description: "Organize a public speak-out to gather concerned citizens together and make your voice heard" 
      full_description: "The purpose of a public speak-out is to bring together individuals with a similar concern and to garner
              positive public attention for your cause. You may also chose to invite the media to cover your event. A public speak-out may be
              smaller than a rally - you can have a successful speak-out and petition event with just 3-10 people. Although not all speak-out 
              events include a petitioning component, adding a petition can be a good way to engage the public, identify potential activists,
              and show decision-makers that your issue is popular. A public speak-out could be anywhere from 15 minutes to a whole afternoon of 
              petitioning. Unlike a rally, speak-out’s are very easy to organize. With a few friends, you could have a speak-out in a few days,
              but, if you’re planning something more elaborate, you might want to give yourself a week to a month to plan."
    movie_screening:
      short_description: "Show a relevant movie to educate the community about your issue"
      full_description: "To take action, first we need to be educated. A movie screening can be a great first step for many people to 
              learn about important issues. Hosting a movie screen can be easy and quick to organize. Your movie screening might be for
              3, 5, or 100 people. You might also decide to add more to your screening like a speaker or a petition drive."
    public_forum:
      short_description: "Assemble experts and host a public forum to educate the community on your issue"
      full_description: "Before we take action, we must be educated. Public forums are intended to inform the general population about
              important issues. Generally, public forums involve a slate of speakers who are experts in the issue you’re discussing who make their
              own statements and take questions from the audience. Generally, public forums are polite events where people come to learn information,
              however, if your topic is controversial you should be prepared for opposition. (clip of health care forums?) A successful public form
              should have a large turnout - depending on the size of your community you should aim for between 20 and 200 (or more!) people at 
              your event. These can be great events to grow your movement. Because this event requires a lot of logistics and recruitment,
              we suggest allowing yourself at least 1-3 months to plan and prepare."
    meet_with_decision_maker:
      short_description: "Get key stakeholders together and present your case to an elected official or other decision-maker"
      full_description: "One thing is for sure - people in power definitely won’t do the right thing unless they’re asked
              (Often they don’t do it then either - that’s why things like rallies, speak-outs, and petition drives exist. But it’s worth 
              it to ask!). The intention of a meeting with a decision-maker - be it a city councilperson, state or federal representative,
              or high school or college administrator - is to make sure they know of your demands. At this meeting, you’ll want 3-5 active
              movement leaders prepared to speak. Because it often takes time to secure a meeting with decision-makers and prepare your
              presentation, we recommend giving yourself at least 2 to 6 weeks to organize a meeting, although, in a pinch, you could do it quicker."
    planning_meeting:
      short_description: "Get your friends and allies together to plan your next move"
      full_description: "Planning meetings are crucial to organizing more intricate actions and to building community that will last. A planning
              meeting could be an impromptu lunch with you and a few other leaders or it could be a larger full-group meeting you plan and
              schedule weeks in advance. Meetings could to primarily to share information, to make decisions, or to delegate tasks. Just make
              sure you have a goal and strong agenda to keep things moving (and maybe snacks too...)"

      full_description: "Have an idea for a creative event? Use this tool to create tasks and assign them."

      - 'Secure 3-5 speakers. Make sure you have several perspectives represented - for example, if you are hosting a forum about mountain top removal, you may want an environmental organizer, a union-worker, a doctor, and a supportive elected official.

      - 'Create an agenda for your event and share the agenda with your event participants.'
      - 'Practice, practice, practice. Meet with your group and communication via email or phone before the meeting to make sure you are all on the same page. Make sure everyone has their talking points written out. It’s important to have a united front and a clear ask at your meeting.'
