'Speak Out': 'The purpose of a public speak-out is to bring together individuals with a similar concern and to garner positive public attention for your cause. You may also chose to invite the media to cover your event. A public speak-out may be smaller than a rally - you can have a successful speak-out and petition event with just 3-10 people. Although not all speak-out events include a petitioning component, adding a petition can be a good way to engage the public, identify potential activists, and show decision-makers that your issue is popular. A public speak-out could be anywhere from 15 minutes to a whole afternoon of petitioning. Unlike a rally, speak-out’s are very easy to organize. With a few friends, you could have a speak-out in a few days, but, if you’re planning something more elaborate, you might want to give yourself a week to a month to plan. '

'Rally': 'Rallies are large events (ideally 20 or more people) intended to garner public and media attention to sway public opinion on an important issue. Rallies can look very different from one another, but generally they have at least 1-3 speakers, signs, and chants. They can last anywhere from 10 minutes to all day, but most rallies are 30 minutes to an hour long. With some time and effort, a good rally can come together in just a few days when necessary, but, if you can, we suggest giving yourself and your team at least a week to a month to organize a successful rally.
