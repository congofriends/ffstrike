<h3>Join a team...</h3>

<div class="well well-sm">
  <p>You must choose a role. Here's an explanation of the roles:</p>
  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>Driver</dt>
    <dd>Any points on your licence? Then don't apply for this role. You've got to transport the team around town. Shy about handing out leaflets in a restaurant? Then you can stay in the car and be the getaway driver.</dd>
    <dt>Mapper</dt>
    <dd>Are you a great back seat driver? Good at using Google Maps. Then Mapper may be the role for you. You'll use a shared Google map to pick out restaurants that no one has contacted yet, then plan a route and print out some maps. </dd>
    <dt>Printer</dt>
    <dd>Your job is simple, but in some ways the most important: printing out and cutting up the leaflets. You'll need a printer and some patience with a pair of scissors. OR you can just go to Kinkos!</dd>
