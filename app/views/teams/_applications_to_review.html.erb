  <h4>Here's who's requested to be on your team</h4>

  <p>
  Please review all the applications as soon as possible. You don't have to accept everyone onto your team. If you feel someone's not a good fit, you can reject them and we'll just tell them to search for a different team. You can also ask people who have applied for a role you've already filled to apply for a different role.
