        Fast-food workers are coming together all over the country to fight for $15 an hour and the right to form a union without retaliation. 
  We work for corporations that are making tremendous profits, but do not pay employees enough to support our families and to cover basic 
  needs like food, health care, rent and transportation. Too many of us are forced to rely on public assistance to scrape by.<br><br>
  These are billion-dollar companies that can afford to pay their employees better. 
  Low-wage jobs are the fastest growing jobs in the nation, and they need to pay more so that workers like us can make ends meet,
  and so that we can rebuild the middle class and get the economy working again.</p>

 "The fast-food workers who have been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/business/strike-for-day-seeks-to-raise-fast-food-pay.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0" target="_blank">walking off their jobs</a> 
  illustrate a central fact of contemporary work in America: 
  As lower-wage occupations have proliferated in the past several years, Americans are increasingly unable to make a living at their jobs.
  They work harder and are paid less than workers in other advanced conuntries. And their wages have stagnated even as executive pay has 
  soared." <small><em>New York Times Editorial</em>, August 7, 2013</small>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"The fast food struggle is a small part of a larger thing..it has to do with the right to collective bargaining;
  it has to do with offshoring jobs the way we have been...it has to do with investing in our nations's infrastructure to put people
  back to work... it is a re-commitment to the American dream." - <small><em>Rep. Keith Ellison on Morning Joe on MSNBC</em>, July 30, 2013</p></small>
