    It's a great idea to team your Facebook account up with Fast Food Strike. We're all about
    awareness and promotion and what better place to do that than Facebook? Plus we can automatically
    do a few simple (non-intrusive) things, like work out where you are and connect you with folks
    in your area, or work out if you're friends have signed up in case you'd like to leaflet with them.
